# SetEvent Computer Networks Assignment 2017/2018

The aim of this work is to develop (in C / C++) a client-server computer program (SetEvent) that
informs clients of a list of events and allow them to choose and register in one of those events.
The events list is saved in a text file and the registrations of the several clients are saved on other
text files, one file per event.
Each user can register only once on each event. Repeated registrations on the same event are not
accepted and are not acknowledged.
